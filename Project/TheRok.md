# "The Rok" basketball application

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition
My client is passionate about creating high quality basketballs that can be customized to fit everyone’s needs. However, since he is new to the field, he still lacks the software to track money, orders, and inventory. The machine he has for making the basketballs also needs supervision. This makes it necessary to complete these tasks manually, which takes a lot of time and can lead to errors that delay delivery of the product. This has become frustrating for both my client and his customers, which is why he requires an application that solves these issues. In addition, he wants to have a login and registration system in order to keep track of his employees. He also wants the application to distinguish between his account and his employees’ accounts so that certain functions of the application cannot be accessed by those without permission.

## Success Criteria
1. The application contains a login and registration feature that uses a username and an appropriate password. [login and registration system]
2. The application will differentiate between the accounts of the owner (my client) and their employees. [distinguish between his (the owner’s) account and his employees’ accounts]
3. The application allows the owner to track money, orders, and purchases [lacks software to track money, orders, and inventory]
4. The application allows the owner to track inventory [lacks software to track money, orders, and inventory]
5. The application features access to the machine that allows the owner to produce more basketballs [machine … also needs supervision]
6. The application allows users to customize the size, color, and type of their basketball [basketballs that can be customized to fit everyone’s needs]
