## Small description
We want to make high quality table tennis rackets with a particular focus on higher level play. To this end, we want to let the customer choose the blade, sponge, and rubber that are within the ITTF standards to create a custom racket with the speed, spin, and control adjusted for both sides. With this, players can get a unique racket that is catered towards their playstyle, bringing their play to the next level.

## Raw meterials
* Wood
* Sponge
