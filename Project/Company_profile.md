## Mantis description
We want to make high quality table tennis rackets with a particular focus on higher level play. To this end, we ensure the following for our products:

### High Degree of Customization
The blade, the sponge, and the rubber: we make our rackets as customizable as possible. This allows the player to carefully choose the speed, spin, and control on both sides of the racket, enabling more tailored and sophisticated play.

### Enhanced Player Experience
By empowering players to create their own unique rackets, not only do we meet their specific needs, but we also allow for a deeper connection between the player and their equipment. As players develop a specialized playstyle thanks to the racket tailored towards their stregths and preferences, players gain satisfaction and confidence, thus elevating their play to the next level.

### Adherance to ITTF Standards
By making sure that all the components of the racket fall under ITTF guidlines, we allow all of our rackets to be used in official table tennis play. We are also ensuring that the rackets provide fair and consistent competition.


## Raw materials
### Wood
Used for making the blade, which serves as the foundation of the table tennis racket. Different materials, layer counts, and flexibility significantly impact the balance between speed, control, and feel.

### Carbon (optional)
Can serve as an additional layer for the blade, enhancing rigidity and speed.

### Sponge
It is located between the blade and the rubber. It affects the speed and control of the racket, depending on the thickness which can range from 1.5mm to 2.3mm. The thicker the sponge, the higher the speed and power of the racket, and the thinner the sponge, the higher the control of the racket

### Rubber
The outer layer of the racket. There are many different types of rubber, but the main categories include pimpled rubber, inverted rubber, and anti-spin rubber. Pimpled rubber has pimples facing outwards and is generally better at generating speed. Inverted rubber has pimples facing inwards and a smooth outside surface which is better for generating spin. Anti-spin rubber is a special type of rubber that mainly covers weakness against spin, but can also be used in deceptive play. The rubbers can be different on both sides, with more experienced players often opting for a side that generates a lot of power, and a side that is spin heavy.

### Table tennis glue
Used to attach the rubber to the blade. The glues that are most commonly used come from standard table tennis brands such as Butterfly, Donic, STIGA, and DHS, as most conventional glues will not work
