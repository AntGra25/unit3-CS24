## Small description
We want to make high quality table tennis rackets with a particular focus on higher level play. To this end, we ensure the following for our products:

### High Degree of Customization
The blade, the sponge, and the rubber: we make our rackets as customizable as possible. This allows the player to carefully choose the speed, spin, and control on both sides of the racket, enabling more tailored and sophisticated play.

### Enhanced Player Experience
By empowering players to create their own unique rackets, not only do we meet their specific needs, but we also allow for a deeper connection between the player and their equipment. As players develop a specialized playstyle thanks to the racket tailored towards their stregths and preferences, players gain satisfaction and confidence, thus elevating their play to the next level.

### Adherance to ITTF Standards
By making sure that all the components of the racket fall under ITTF guidlines, we allow all of our rackets to be used in official table tennis play. We are also ensuring that the rackets provide fair and consistent competition.


we want to let the customer choose the blade, sponge, and rubber that are within the ITTF standards to create a custom racket with the speed, spin, and control adjusted for both sides. With this, players can get a unique racket that is catered towards their playstyle, bringing their play to the next level.
